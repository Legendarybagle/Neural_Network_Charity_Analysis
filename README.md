# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview
With machine learning and neural networks, use the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results
* Data Processing
* * the 'STATUS' variable was the target for the machine learning algortithm.
* * every other value was used as a feature except for "NAME" and "EIN" which were dropped as they were unique idetifiers and thus entirely useless for the algorithm.
* Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
